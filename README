## Project Workflow

1. **Construct Data Files:**
    - Run the `run_scripts.sh` bash script to generate files in the `data_files` directory.
    - The script implements Python scripts in `calculate_features` to create the following files for each subdirectory:
        1. Reconstructed PDB file (`id_rec.pdb`)
        2. Backbone structure file (`id_rec_bb.txt`)
        3. Bond angle file (`id_ba.txt`)
        4. Bond length file (`id_bl.txt`)
        5. Dihedral angle file (`id_da.txt`)

    **Directory Structure:**
    ```plaintext
    data_files
    └── 1by7
        ├── 1by7_ba.txt
        ├── 1by7_bl.txt
        ├── 1by7_da.txt
        └── 1by7_rec.txt
    ```

2. **Construct PH Files:**
    - Run the `run_ph.sh` script to generate the `id_rec_bb.txt` files from Step 1.
    - This script utilizes `ph_functions.py` to compute persistence diagrams, vectors, and landscapes for each backbone structure. The results are stored in the `ph_files` directory.

3. **Run `geo_prep.py`:**
    - Execute `geo_prep.py` to create an index for your data and place it in the `datasets_for_geo` directory.

4. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Ensure all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed.

5. **Run `finetune_knots.sh`:**
    - Execute the script in the forked PaddleHelix repository located at `PaddleHelix/apps/pretrained_compound/ChemRL/GEM/scripts`.
    - Modify the `data_path` in the script to point to the JSON files generated by `geo_prep.py`.
