# Workflow

1. Construct a data_files directory with structure

data_files
    - 1by7
        - 1by7_ba.txt
        - 1by7_bl.txt
        - 1by7_da.txt
        - 1by7_rec.txt
    ... etc

2. Run geo_prep.py to create the index for your data, and place it in datasets_for_geo

3. Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt are installed

4. Run finetune_knots.sh in the forked PaddleHelix repository located in this repository . It can be found in PaddleHelix/apps/pretrained_compound/ChemRL/GEM/scripts. Ensure that you modify the data_path to point to your json files generated by geo_prep.py
