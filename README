Project Workflow:

1. Construct a data_files directory with PDB files from PDBs directory by running run_scripts.sh. 
This bash script implements the Python scripts in calculate_features and generates the following five files for each subdirectory:
(1) a reconstructed PDB file (id_rec.pdb)
(2) a backbone structure file (id_rec_bb.txt)
(3) a bond angle file (id_ba.txt) 
(4) a bond length file (id_bl.txt)
(5) a dihedral angle file (id_da.txt)

Structure of the directory:
data_files
    - 1by7
        - 1by7_ba.txt
        - 1by7_bl.txt
        - 1by7_da.txt
        - 1by7_rec.txt
    ... etc

2. Construct a ph_files directory with id_rec_bb.txt files from Step 1 by running run_ph.sh which implements ph_functions.py to compute the persistence diagrams, vectors, landscape for each backbone structure.

3. Run geo_prep.py to create the index for your data, and place it in datasets_for_geo

4. Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt are installed

5. Run finetune_knots.sh in the forked PaddleHelix repository located in this repository . It can be found in PaddleHelix/apps/pretrained_compound/ChemRL/GEM/scripts. Ensure that you modify the data_path to point to your json files generated by geo_prep.py
